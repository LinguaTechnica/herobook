# Hero Book
> Blocks: 1-4

This lesson starts with a brisk testing walk through. Feel free to skip straight to the exercises if students are already comfortable with how to create tests with Angular.

This exercise is very flexible for intermediate to advanced lesson planning. It can be broken up into 1-4 blocks, with an all-day lab requiring completion of the core app, which does not include the optional stretch goals. Students who have higher skill level have the option to complete any of the stretch goals to fill the time.

### For Groups

The exercise assumes a pair-programming setup.

The full exercise could be turned into an all day group project. Recommended group size: 2-4 students, where each pair can develop a separate feature and the team can share a repository for code reviews.
 
 Stretch goals can be easily added and ideas adapted. The exercise is focused around the following concepts:

Primary:
* TDD Components(primary goal)
* TDD Services (CRUDing)

Secondary:
* Components
* Observables (HTTP, forms)

### Hero Book API

The API is open access for read-only requests (GET only). To make POST/PATCH requests students will need to set the `Authorization` header to 'SUPERSTUDY'.
